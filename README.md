If you did not use the given Vue project template, describe how can we run your code:

  If you don't have yarn installed yet, you need to run: npm install --global yarn.

  1. run: yarn; to download the dependencies.

  2. run: yarn start or npm start; to start the react app.

Do you have any other comments regarding your deliverable?

  Yes, I do. 
  There are few jobs positions that are matching with job listings in the API. 
  So you may find it difficult to find a job with that position function.

Do you have any comments/feedback about the task we gave you?

  Nothing
